/*
You're tasked with modeling vehicles and cars in a transportation app:
    - A Vehicle has type and speed properties.
    - All vehicles can start and stop.
    - A Car inherits from Vehicle and has an additional drive method.

    a- Implement this using ES5 function constructors
     - Limit the number of Vehicle instances to 50. If an attempt is made to create the 51st vehicle, throw an error with the message: 'Vehicle limit reached'.
     - the implementation of the methods can be console.log only or you can leave them empty
 
    b- Write a function that checks whether an object is an instance of Car using two different ways
